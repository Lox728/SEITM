# SEITM
TIPE project - y2021/2022 - in collaboration with J. Racki and H.Bourdais  

For this project, we had to work on the topic of Health  
  
Knowing the work of Mr Mehdi Moussa√Ød (Fouloscopie on Youtube), we decided to study how two sciences such as Fouloscopy (The study of crowds) and Epidemiology (The study of epidemics) could work together by simulating an epidemic spreading in a crowd  
  
With this program, you will go through a homepage, a tuto explaining briefly how the simulation works, a menu where you can play on various parameters, and activate or not some others, and finally, the simulation itself, evolving in real time.  
  
To use this program :  
  
Be sure you have an IDE that can run .py files in the first place (Spyder for exmaple)  
Then, download the folder SEITM_EN if you want the English version of the program, or SEITM_FR if you want the French one  
Finally, in both cases, open the "seitm5.py" file in your IDE, and run the program !
