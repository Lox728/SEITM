# SEITM
TIPE project - y2021/2022 - in collaboration with J. Racki and H.Bourdais  









To use this program :  
  
Be sure you have an IDE that can run .py files in the first place (Spyder for exmaple)  
Then, download the folder SEITM_EN if you want the English version of the program, or SEITM_FR if you want the French one  
Finally, in both cases, open the "seitm5.py" file in your IDE, and run the program !
